        <h1>Biewer Terrier</h1>
        <div>
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The Biewer Yorkshire Terrier is a great companion dog. He is ready to accompany the owner everywhere, causing
                good-natured smiles from passers-by. This is not a sofa dog, but a full-fledged terrier with expressive charisma and
                a
                serious character. The Beaver Yorkie has a lot of energy, so it will not be boring with him.

            <h2>Origin</h2>
            <p>Like many other breeds, the Biewer Yorkshire Terrier breed appeared by chance. The first representatives were shown
                at
                the show ring in Wiesbaden in 1988 by breeders of Yorkshire terriers Werner and Gertrud Biever. In their kennel,
                puppies
                were unexpectedly born with an absolutely non-standard color for the breed. A year later, the new breed was
                registered
                by the German club A.C.H.-L.e.V.

            <h2>Character</h2>
            <p>Usually representatives of decorative breeds have a calm character. But the Biewer Yorkshire Terrier is not like that
                at
                all. He is energetic, ready to play all day long. He is constantly busy or interested in something, becomes the
                "tail"
                of the owner and with great joy accompanies all his movements around the house and not only. The nature of the
                representatives of the breed differs significantly depending on the sex. Boys are more balanced and calm, but girls
                can
                have truly feline character traits: independence, unpredictability, cunning. But the owner and family are adored by
                both. Beaver Yorkies are friendly with children, especially if they grow up together. They are distrustful and
                attentive
                to strangers, but if they see the ownerâ€™s disposition towards them, they are ready to make friends. The Biewer
                Yorkie
                differs from the classic Yorkshire Terriers in an incredibly affectionate and calm character and a stronger psyche.

            <h2>Health</h2>
            <p>Beaver York has a fairly good health. He did not inherit the bone and joint problems from the classic Yorkshire
                Terrier.
                But, unfortunately, dogs of this breed are prone to other genetic diseases, including dislocation of the lens of the
                eye
                and progressive retinal atrophy, urolithiasis, food allergies, and pancreatitis. Therefore, when choosing a pet, it
                is
                worth asking about the genetic characteristics of the parents. Reliable nurseries usually provide this data without
                any
                problems. In addition to genetic health problems, a dog can develop various diseases with improper care and
                nutrition.
                Therefore, in addition to healthy ancestors, proper care and diet are important for a pet.
